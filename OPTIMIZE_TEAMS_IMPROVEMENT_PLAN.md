# Team Optimization Improvement Plan

## Current Implementation Analysis

### What it does now (Lines 625-853):
1. **Random sampling**: Tries 500 random team configurations
2. **Parallel processing**: Uses ThreadPoolExecutor with up to 8 workers
3. **Greedy skill assignment**: For each team, tries combinations of skills
4. **Scoring function**: Combines individual scores + pairwise synergies

### Problems with current approach:
1. ‚ùå **Random = Inefficient**: 500 attempts might miss optimal solution
2. ‚ùå **No learning**: Doesn't use information from previous attempts
3. ‚ùå **Skill assignment bottleneck**: Nested brute force is slow
4. ‚ùå **No diversity**: May get stuck in local optima
5. ‚ùå **Hard to tune**: Magic numbers everywhere (500, max_skill_combos=300, etc.)

---

## Better Approaches (Ranked by Complexity)

### ü•â Level 1: Improved Heuristics (Easiest - Recommended Start)
**Time to implement**: 1-2 days  
**Performance gain**: 2-5x better solutions, similar speed

#### Approach: Greedy + Local Search
```python
def optimize_teams_greedy(self, heroes, skills):
    """
    1. Sort heroes/skills by individual scores (best first)
    2. Greedily assign to teams considering synergies
    3. Use local search to swap members between teams
    4. Repeat multiple times with different orderings
    """
    
    # Phase 1: Greedy construction
    # - Start with best hero, assign to team 1
    # - Pick next hero that has best synergy with team 1
    # - Continue until team 1 has 3 heroes
    # - Repeat for teams 2 and 3
    
    # Phase 2: Local search improvements
    # - Try swapping heroes between teams
    # - Try swapping skills between teams
    # - Accept swap if it improves total score
    # - Repeat until no improvement
    
    # Phase 3: Multi-start
    # - Repeat 50-100 times with random orderings
    # - Keep best solution found
```

**Advantages:**
- ‚úÖ Much faster than random sampling
- ‚úÖ Guaranteed to find reasonable solution
- ‚úÖ Easy to understand and debug
- ‚úÖ Uses your existing scoring function

**Key improvements over current:**
1. **Greedy construction**: Build teams smartly instead of randomly
2. **Local search**: Refine solution by swapping
3. **Multi-start**: Run multiple times to escape local optima

### ü•à Level 2: Genetic Algorithm (Medium - Great for Learning)
**Time to implement**: 3-5 days  
**Performance gain**: 5-10x better solutions  
**ML Learning**: Excellent introduction to evolutionary algorithms

#### Concept:
Teams are "DNA" that evolve over generations to become better

```python
from deap import base, creator, tools, algorithms
import random

def optimize_teams_genetic(self, heroes, skills, population_size=100, generations=50):
    """
    Genetic Algorithm for team optimization
    
    Chromosome (individual): A complete team configuration
    - 9 heroes (3 per team) + 18 skills (6 per team, 2 per hero)
    
    Fitness: Your calculate_team_score function
    
    Operators:
    - Selection: Tournament selection (pick best from random subset)
    - Crossover: Swap teams between two configurations
    - Mutation: Swap heroes/skills within or between teams
    """
    
    # 1. Create initial population (100 random team configs)
    population = []
    for _ in range(population_size):
        individual = create_random_team_config(heroes, skills)
        population.append(individual)
    
    # 2. Evolve for N generations
    for generation in range(generations):
        # Evaluate fitness
        fitnesses = [calculate_fitness(ind) for ind in population]
        
        # Select parents (tournament selection)
        parents = tournament_selection(population, fitnesses, k=50)
        
        # Create offspring via crossover
        offspring = []
        for i in range(0, len(parents), 2):
            child1, child2 = crossover(parents[i], parents[i+1])
            offspring.extend([child1, child2])
        
        # Mutate offspring
        for child in offspring:
            if random.random() < 0.2:  # 20% mutation rate
                mutate(child)
        
        # Replace population (elitism: keep top 10%)
        combined = population + offspring
        combined.sort(key=calculate_fitness, reverse=True)
        population = combined[:population_size]
    
    # 3. Return best solution
    best = max(population, key=calculate_fitness)
    return convert_to_team_format(best)
```

#### Key Components:

**1. Encoding (Chromosome representation):**
```python
class TeamConfiguration:
    def __init__(self):
        # Team assignments as lists
        self.team1_heroes = []  # 3 heroes
        self.team2_heroes = []  # 3 heroes
        self.team3_heroes = []  # 3 heroes
        
        # Skill assignments as dict: hero -> [skill1, skill2]
        self.skill_assignments = {}
    
    def to_chromosome(self):
        """Convert to list for GA operators"""
        # [h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6, h7, h8, h9, s1, s2, ..., s18]
        return (self.team1_heroes + self.team2_heroes + self.team3_heroes + 
                flatten(self.skill_assignments))
```

**2. Crossover (Breeding):**
```python
def crossover_teams(parent1, parent2):
    """Single-point crossover: swap entire teams"""
    child1 = parent1.copy()
    child2 = parent2.copy()
    
    # Swap team 2 and team 3 between parents
    child1.team2_heroes = parent2.team2_heroes
    child1.team3_heroes = parent2.team3_heroes
    
    child2.team2_heroes = parent1.team2_heroes
    child2.team3_heroes = parent1.team3_heroes
    
    # Recalculate skill assignments for swapped teams
    child1.skill_assignments = reassign_skills(child1)
    child2.skill_assignments = reassign_skills(child2)
    
    return child1, child2
```

**3. Mutation (Random changes):**
```python
def mutate_team_config(individual):
    """Randomly modify the configuration"""
    mutation_type = random.choice(['swap_heroes', 'swap_skills', 'reassign_skills'])
    
    if mutation_type == 'swap_heroes':
        # Swap a hero between two teams
        team1_idx = random.randint(0, 2)
        team2_idx = random.randint(0, 2)
        
        all_teams = [individual.team1_heroes, individual.team2_heroes, individual.team3_heroes]
        h1 = all_teams[0][random.randint(0, 2)]
        h2 = all_teams[1][random.randint(0, 2)]
        
        # Swap them
        all_teams[0][all_teams[0].index(h1)] = h2
        all_teams[1][all_teams[1].index(h2)] = h1
    
    elif mutation_type == 'swap_skills':
        # Swap skills between two heroes
        hero1, hero2 = random.sample(list(individual.skill_assignments.keys()), 2)
        skill1 = random.choice(individual.skill_assignments[hero1])
        skill2 = random.choice(individual.skill_assignments[hero2])
        
        individual.skill_assignments[hero1].remove(skill1)
        individual.skill_assignments[hero1].append(skill2)
        individual.skill_assignments[hero2].remove(skill2)
        individual.skill_assignments[hero2].append(skill1)
    
    elif mutation_type == 'reassign_skills':
        # Completely reassign skills for one team
        team = random.choice([1, 2, 3])
        # ... reassign skills greedily for that team
    
    return individual
```

**4. Fitness function (already have!):**
```python
def calculate_fitness(individual):
    """Use your existing scoring logic"""
    total_score = 0.0
    
    for team_heroes, team_skills in individual.get_teams():
        total_score += calculate_team_score(team_heroes, team_skills)
    
    return total_score
```

#### Implementation with DEAP library:
```python
from deap import base, creator, tools, algorithms
import random

def optimize_teams_ga(self, heroes, skills, pop_size=100, n_gen=50):
    """Genetic Algorithm using DEAP library"""
    
    # 1. Setup DEAP
    creator.create("FitnessMax", base.Fitness, weights=(1.0,))  # Maximize score
    creator.create("Individual", list, fitness=creator.FitnessMax)
    
    toolbox = base.Toolbox()
    
    # Individual generator
    toolbox.register("individual", self._create_random_team_config, heroes, skills)
    toolbox.register("population", tools.initRepeat, list, toolbox.individual)
    
    # Genetic operators
    toolbox.register("evaluate", self._evaluate_team_config)
    toolbox.register("mate", self._crossover_teams)
    toolbox.register("mutate", self._mutate_team, indpb=0.2)
    toolbox.register("select", tools.selTournament, tournsize=3)
    
    # 2. Run evolution
    population = toolbox.population(n=pop_size)
    
    # Use built-in algorithm
    final_pop, logbook = algorithms.eaSimple(
        population, toolbox,
        cxpb=0.7,  # 70% crossover probability
        mutpb=0.2,  # 20% mutation probability
        ngen=n_gen,
        verbose=True
    )
    
    # 3. Return best
    best = tools.selBest(final_pop, k=1)[0]
    return self._convert_to_team_format(best)
```

**Advantages:**
- ‚úÖ Explores solution space intelligently
- ‚úÖ Balances exploration (mutation) vs exploitation (crossover)
- ‚úÖ Proven to work well for combinatorial problems
- ‚úÖ Great for learning evolutionary algorithms
- ‚úÖ DEAP library handles complexity for you

### ü•á Level 3: Integer Linear Programming (Advanced - Best Solution)

**Advantages:**
- ‚úÖ **Guaranteed optimal** (within time limit)
- ‚úÖ Considers all constraints explicitly
- ‚úÖ Solver handles the hard work
- ‚úÖ Can add complex constraints easily

**Disadvantages:**
- ‚ùå Complex to set up
- ‚ùå May be slow for very large problems (>20 heroes, >40 skills)
- ‚ùå Need to linearize non-linear synergy terms

**When to use:**
- Small-medium problem sizes (<20 heroes)
- Need provably optimal solution
- Have complex constraints (e.g., role requirements, skill restrictions)

## Recommendation: Start with Level 1 (Greedy + Local Search)

### Why?
1. **Fast to implement** (1-2 days)
2. **Easy to understand** and debug
3. **Big improvement** over random (2-5x better)
4. **Foundation** for more advanced methods
5. **Uses existing code** (your scoring functions)
